TO INTRODUCE
-------------
This repository holds a set of Lua scripts to aid in playing Beyond Chaos, a FF6 randomizer. This code will make a separate
window that will display highlighted equipment information while on the Equip and Relic Menus that is normally only displayed
in the Item Menu after selecting an item. Ideally, this will ease changing and viewing equipment.

TO USE
-----------------------------------------
Keep all the scripts in the same folder. Only run the 'FF6BC Scouter.lua' file.

I've only tested this with the BizHawk-2.5.2 Emulator with the BSNES core. I don't know if different cores will affect
anything. I'm assuming there are no guarantees this will work on another emulator as I do use some of the BizHawk Lua functions
and I imagine I'd have to code around that for SNES9x or another emulator that runs Lua Scripts. I'm not certain of this, feel
free to correct me if I'm wrong.

TO DO
-------------------------------------------
- Decent Graphics/Layout for nicer look and increased readability
- Option for Less "Adaptive" Layout, so Item Characteristics are always in the same part of the window
- Option for "More Adaptive" Layout, i.e, being able to resize the window.
- Script for the Esper Menu, so one can have an overview of their Espers, Spells, and Learn Percentages At a glance (or at
    least a scroll)
- Script for the Rage Menu to give info from the cursor without selecting, and maybe being able to sort/highlight by Elemental
    Affinities, Statuses, or Highest Multiplier
- Access the aforementioned information while in battle
- Access item information from shop sell menu
- Stat and Command overview for all party members from main manu

TO FIX
------------------------------------------
- The window may flicker with text during battle, and possibly elsewhere (but it shouldn't affect anything)
