TO INTRODUCE
-------------
This repository holds a set of Lua scripts to aid in playing Beyond Chaos, a FF6 randomizer. This code will make a separate
window that will display highlighted equipment information while on the Equip and Relic Menus that is normally only displayed
in the Item Menu after selecting an item. Ideally, this will ease changing and viewing equipment.

TO USE
-----------------------------------------
- Use with the BizHawk SNES Emulator (Tested with BizHawk v2.5.2)
- Keep all scripts together in the same folder
- Load only 'FF6BC Scouter.lua' from the folder

NOTE: Does not work with other emulators that support Lua scripts due to use of BizHawk-specific Lua Functions

TO DO
-------------------------------------------
- A couple of effects are NOT displayed: 1/2 enc, No enc, and maybe some others
- Decent Graphics/Layout for nicer look and increased readability
- Option for Less "Adaptive" Layout, so Item Characteristics are always in the same part of the window
- Option for "More Adaptive" Layout, i.e, being able to resize the window.
- Script for the Esper Menu, so one can have an overview of their Espers, Spells, and Learn Percentages At a glance (or at
    least a scroll)
- Script for the Rage Menu to give info from the cursor without selecting, and maybe being able to sort/highlight by Elemental
    Affinities, Statuses, or Highest Multiplier
- Access the aforementioned information while in battle
- Access item information from shop sell menu
- Stat and Command overview for all party members from main manu
- Pop up with info about when picking up treasures or getting enemy drops/steals/morphs

TO FIX
------------------------------------------
- The window may flicker with text during battle, and possibly elsewhere (but it shouldn't affect anything)

TO CONTACT
