# FF6-BC-Scouter
A set of Lua scripts to aid in playing Beyond Chaos, a FF6 randomizer. My goal with this is primarly to cut down on what I consider metagaming, the tracking of the variance of known variables during playthroughs.

A separate window will pop up when the script is run and should be blank other than when the cursor is over equipment in the Item, Equip, and Relic Menus. It's a bit of a mess still, but I wanted to get this out to get feedback and more ideas.

A few other things I'd like to add:
-------------------------------------------
- Decent Graphics/Layout for nicer look and increased readability
- Option for Less "Adaptive" Layout, so Item Characteristics are always in the same part of the screen
- Script for the Esper Menu, so one can have an overview of their Espers, Spells, and Learn Percentages At a glance (or at
    least a scroll)
- Script for the Rage Menu to give info from the cursor without selecting, and maybe being able to sort/highlight by Elemental
    Affinities, Statuses, or Highest Multiplier
- Access the aforementioned information while in battle
